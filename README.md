# Blastboard

This is the new codebase for Blastboard. The previous version written in C++ will no longer be developed. It will remain on GitHub as a reference to some important underlying Qt C++ functions.

### ReadMe will be updated with more information in a later commit, when basic login and dashboard/home-screen functionality is restored.
